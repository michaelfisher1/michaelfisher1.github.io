        extraordinary!</p>

              ascending to chief of his clan, Mok'rar "Wildhammer" has brought in his people to serve many purposes in the Quester community, including security, quality assurance, and repossession and distribution of earned equipment.</p>

              in Australia he was working with them as part of a larger mining industry. Before coming through the rift, he was on track to continue with the company and eventually move in to what he called "Application Development and Support".
              We do not understand many of the things he says, but he seems to be driven to make Quester a reality and a positive influence in the realm.</p>

              to the team, and his vast library at his Inscrutable Tower has helped the Quester community make great strides in the portal network that allows Quester Associates to move across the realms with ease.</p>
